(This code already reads an Excel file with potentially multi-level column headers, flattens the columns, and produces a single-level column DataFrame.)

Extended Task:

Enhance the existing flattening logic to also handle multi-level row indexes (i.e., if the DataFrame’s index is multi-level, flatten that into a single column or set of columns).

Insert the resulting data into a configured database table, with robust handling:

Table creation or existence check

Handling of conflicts or duplicates (upsert logic or simple inserts)

Transaction handling or commit/rollback

Logging (including success/failure)

The final code must include:

Import statements for DB connectivity (e.g., psycopg2 or sqlalchemy), logging, Pandas, etc.

A main function or usage example (e.g., if __name__ == "__main__":) demonstrating how to call the script with command-line arguments:

--file_path

--sheet_name

--header_rows

--skiprows

--prefix_sep

--index_levels_to_flatten

--db_host, --db_port, --db_name, --db_user, --db_password, --db_table_name

Possibly --create_table or --truncate_table

Thorough docstrings and minimal inline comments explaining how the multi-level row index flattening is done, and how the insertion logic works.

Production-oriented best practices, such as:

Proper exception handling

Logging

Avoiding SQL injection (using parameterized queries or SQLAlchemy)

Possibly configurable schema inference for creating the DB table dynamically

Quality Standards:

Must comply with Python 3 best practices.

Reusable and maintainable structure.

Thorough docstrings and usage examples.

Clean code style (meaningful variable names, minimal magic numbers).

Production-oriented error handling (try/except blocks, logging, transaction management).

Output: Generate a single, self-contained Python script that:

Uses the existing code as a base for flattening multi-level columns.

Extends it to handle flattening multi-level row indexes.

Inserts (or upserts) the resulting DataFrame into a database table under configurable settings.

The script should not be minimal or “toy” — it must be truly industrial-grade so it can be dropped into a real ETL pipeline with minimal changes.

### How to Use This Prompt

1. **Copy** this entire text (including the triple backticks and the full code snippet).
2. **Paste** it into your Large Language Model environment (e.g., a GPT-4 session).
3. The model should produce a complete script with:
   - The original flattening logic extended for multi-level row indexes,
   - Database connectivity and insertion (with robust error handling and logging),
   - Configurable arguments to handle various scenarios.

Once generated, **review and refine** the script to match your exact environment (e.g., DB credentials, upsert logic) before integrating it into your production pipeline.
